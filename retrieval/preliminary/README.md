These are programs I began working on but stopped. They aren't outdated necessarily, but they are based on old versions. However, they may contain useful information for when we implement these ideas again.

new_new_combined_retriever.py replaced new_combined_retriever.py with the idea of invoking partial clouds with only a single model run (instead of averaging two). It would be much faster, but I did not verify it.

retrieve_eclipse.py was written based on v2 or v3 of PLATON's eclipse retrieving, which was buggy. There is now v5, but maybe the same set-up is required.
