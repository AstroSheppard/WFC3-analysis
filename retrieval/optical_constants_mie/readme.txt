This compilation includes the optical constants of different potential condensates in astrophysical environments from Kitzmann&Heng (2018). More detailed information on the compilation can be found in Kitzmann&Heng (2018). The compilation is available on http:://www.exoclime.org as well, where also potential, future updates will be released.

Each text file contains three header lines and three, tab-separated data columns.
The first header line contains the condensate's chemical formula and the corresponding references, as well as additional information on e.g. temperatures and anisotropic or amorphous materials.
The second header line contains the number of data points in the file.
The third header line gives information on the contents of the three data columns.

The first data column is the wavelength in micrometres, the second is the real part of the refractive index, the third column contains the corresponding imaginary part.
