\f0\fs24 \cf0 lds.csv contains the nonlinear LD coefficients for each of my 4-pixel bins from Nikolay for hatp41b. Nik_lds are the ads he used in his ~10pixel spectrum. \
\
The marg_no_adjust, marg_no_adjust_no_orbit, marg_no_orbit, and marg_no_resids were all combined into marg_new, which is used with binfit_new. These \'93new\'94 programs include F/R capability and the 125 models (for the other visit long slopes).\
\
Unclear what marg_mcmc.py is here. From June 8? Maybe I copied over to use as an example for MCMC? Have not used it yet for spectra.}
